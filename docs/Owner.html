        <p class="OwnerInfo">Hello, I'm Cade. I am the owner of HVAP Security Solutions. I started this business because I believe everyone should feel safe where they are. I thought the best way to ensure this was provide the feeling of security. I live by the quote "Do exactly what you ask of your men" from General Patton. I spent 4 years in the U.S. military prior to creating this company. I spent my time as a gunner on an Abrams tank.</p>
